# visual-checksum
Visual checksum for document validity

# Concept

On all passports and most official UK documents (DBS, DVLA, Education certificates) there are small lines which appear to be randomly placed. This project started as a sort of cryptanalysis of this feature; I justified these lines as a sort of checksum, and designed my own implementation based on HMAC.
